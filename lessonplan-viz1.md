## Lesson Outline:

**Step**: Problem <br/>
**Time**: 5 min

_Goal/Scenario:_<br/>
Same animal shelter dataset!! Those poor animals!

_Learning Goals in sequence:_<br/>
- Explain and understand different types plots and their use cases
- Identify and adjust the anatomy of a matplotlib plot
- Explain the difference between plot types and justify their use cases:
  - barplots
  - histogram
  - scatter plot
  -  pie char
- Visualize data using the matplotlib library in python


**Step**: Activation <br/>
**Time**: 5 min

Discussion prompts:
- why are visualizations important?


**Step**: Learning Goal 1: _Explain and understand different types plots and their use cases_ <br/>
**Time**: 17 min

_Demonstrate_: 10 min <br/>


_Application_: 3 min <br/>


_Informal assessment_: 2 min <br/>


**Step**: Learning Goal 2: _Identify and adjust the anatomy of a matplotlib plot_ <br/>
**Time**: 16 min

_Demonstrate_: 15 min <br/>
- Introduce syntax for labelling and styling in Matplotlib
- Show examples of how we can change colors and styles of lines/graphs/labels

_Application_: 3 min <br/>
- Students add labels and styles to their existing visualizations

_Informal assessment_: 2 min <br/>
"Quick fist of five check, how confident do we feel about moving on? zero is not at all comfortable. five is ready to go."
- follow up with those students who do not feel confident

**Step**: Learning Goal 3: _Explain the difference between plot types and justify their use cases_ <br/>
**Time**: 25 min

_Synthesis_: 1 min <br/>


_Application_: 18 min <br/>


**Step**: Integration: Visualize data using the matplotlib library in python



**Step**: Assessment:  <br/>
**Time**: 5 min<br/>
- Have selected pairs of students share their findings

**Step**: Reflection:  <br/>
**Time**: 1 min <br/>
- What are your takeaways from learning about visualizations?
